				<h1>Secondary Research </h1>
				<p class="info"> Researching the current events surrounding disability in America. .</p>
			</header>
			<p> <strong> Explore the most recent news in your client's field. Use the Internet, newspapers, magazines,
					or journals to know what’s new. This can be news stories of interest, relevant scientific research,
					or anything that could help you in finding a solution to the design challenge.</strong>
				<br>
				<br> 
				I looked broadly at disability in South Carolina and the United States. This is a very broad topic,
				so
				sometimes the information was very general and some articles focused in on specific disabilities and
				conditions.
				<br>
				<br>
				The recent news on disability was varied but not extensive. Articles discuss
				<a
					href="https://abcnews4.com/news/local/group-of-disability-focused-nonprofits-come-together-to-address-covid-19-vaccine-issues-wciv">
					how COVID impacted those with disabilities </a>
				along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLyUBNBnBl8&t=87s"> uplifting accessibility stories
				</a>.
				What I
				learned from these articles is that communities need to be intentional about reaching those with
				disabilities and making an united effort to include them in a holistic way.
				<br>
				<br> 


				<strong>Try to find recent innovations in your client's particular area. They could be technological,
					behavioral, or cultural. </strong>
				<br>
				<br>
				It is hard to search broadly when in regards to innovations, since they are so unique to each
				condition
				and individual. Because of this, I looked more specifically. I found an <a
					href="https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/innovation-changing-the-face-of-disability/">
					article</a> on biotechnology for prosthetics as well as for physiological monitoring and
				socio-emotional tools for autism from MIT. This section was particularly interesting because it showed
				the positive impact
				technology can have on people. I also found an article on <a
					href="https://www.wltx.com/article/news/community/usc-adapts-toys-for-kids-with-disabilities/101-0efb3f9d-2160-49ec-8f36-6a8642a32795">adapted
					toys </a>
				for children and how they are often inaccessible to families but have such a positive impact on the
				quality of life for the child.

				<br>
				<br>

				<strong> Take a look at other solutions in your area. Which ones worked? Which ones didn’t? Are there any that feel similar to what you might design? Any solutions that have inspired you to make one of your own?  </strong>
				<br>
				<br>

				I found two websites that are successful in their design:
				<a href="https://bestdayfoundation.org/"> bestdayfoundation.org </a>
				<a href="https://www.ecf.net/"> www.ecf.net </a>. Their navigation is clear and well organized and their
				visuals are appealing. The necessary information is easy to find and their target audience is
				reflected well in the visuals.
				<br>
				<br>

				<strong> Is there any market data that you can dig up that may be relevant in helping you solve the design challenge? </strong>
				<br>
				<br>

				"People with disabilities make up a large, but diverse and underserved, segment of the US population. According to recent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 67 million adults in the US—or 26% of the population—reported living with at least one type of disability."

			<div class="box alt">
				<div class="row 50% uniform">
					
					<div class="4u"><span class="image fit">	<img src="./images/chart_1.jpeg" alt="Bar chart showing that marketers worldwide can recall people with mental or physical disabilities being represented positively in their recent campaigns 15% of the time, compared to women 69% of the time." /></span></div>
					<div class="4u"><img src="./images/chart_2.jpeg" alt="Pie chart showing that 26% of adults in America have mobility, cognitive, independent living, hearing, or vision disabilities" /></span></div>

			"The American Institutes for Research (AIR) calculated in 2018 that the 20 million US working adults (ages 16 to 24) with disabilities—not including their extended families, support networks, and allies—had a collective after-tax disposable income of $490 billion, slightly lower than those of Black ($501 billion) and Hispanic consumers ($582 billion). Discretionary income averaged about $17,000 per person, or $21 million in aggregate, more than the $19 million for the Black and Hispanic market segments combined."
			<br>
			<br>
			"Even when they are represented, people with disabilities are often portrayed inauthentically. “I’ve seen several ads that include amputees, but they were just models whose legs had been removed during photo editing,” said Craig Radford, vice president of strategy and business development at Communication Service for the Deaf (CSD), which provides technology, resources, and services for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. “It’s important that marketing shows actual individuals with disabilities.”
			<br> 
			<br>
			"Michael Janger, assistant professor of marketing at Gallaudet University and a market research consultant, believes marketers can avoid many of these miscues by doing their homework. “There’s a lack of research about people with disabilities, so marketers must collect more data to understand their needs and wants,” he said. “The more you know what they want, what they like, and what their buying habits are, the better able you are to make your product, marketing efforts, and communications accessible to them."
