						<p class="info"> Researching the current events surrounding disability in America.  .</p>
					</header>
					<p> I looked broadly at disability in South Carolina and the United States. This is a very broad topic,
						so
						sometimes the information was very general and some articles focused in on specific disabilities and
						conditions.
						<br>
						The recent news on disability was varied but not extensive. Articles discuss 
						] <a href="https://abcnews4.com/news/local/group-of-disability-focused-nonprofits-come-together-to-address-covid-19-vaccine-issues-wciv"> how COVID impacted those with disabilities </a>
						along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLyUBNBnBl8&t=87s"> uplifting accessibility stories </a>.
						What I
						learned from these articles is that communities need to be intentional about reaching those with
						disabilities and making an united effort to include them in a holistic way.
						<br>
						<br>
						It is hard to search broadly when in regards to innovations, since they are so unique to each
						condition
						and individual. Because of this, I looked more specifically. I found an <a href="https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/innovation-changing-the-face-of-disability/"> article</a> on biotechnology for prosthetics as well as for physiological monitoring and socio-emotional tools for autism from MIT. This section was particularly interesting because it showed the positive impact
						technology can have on people. I also found an article on <a href="https://www.wltx.com/article/news/community/usc-adapts-toys-for-kids-with-disabilities/101-0efb3f9d-2160-49ec-8f36-6a8642a32795">adapted
							toys </a>
						for children and how they are often inaccessible to families but have such a positive impact on the
						quality of life for the child.
						
						I found two websites that are successful in their design:
						<a href="https://bestdayfoundation.org/"> bestdayfoundation.org </a>
						<a href="https://www.ecf.net/"> www.ecf.net </a>. Their navigation is clear and well organized and their
						visuals are appealing. The necessary information is easy to find and their target audience is
						reflected well in the visuals.</p>
