				<h1>Interviews</h1>
				<p class="info">Interviews conducted with  users to gain information about the ways this website will be
					used.</p>
			</header>
			<h2> Interview 1: Alyssa Johnson</h2>
			<p> <i> Alyssa Johnson is a relative of someone with Down Syndrome. She is a user of
				this website.</i> </p>
			<p> <strong> 1. What information are you looking for most often on this website? </strong>
				<br>
				I was mostly trying to locate information regarding the various social activities offered for young
				adults with special needs and disabilities.
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong> 2. What do you enjoy about the website? </strong>
				<br>
				It was straightforward with the content and relatively easy to navigate from my mobile device.
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong> 3. What frustrates you on the website? </strong>
				<br>
				I wouldn’t say I was frustrated about anything. That being said, the only thing that immediately comes
				to mind is the demographic mentioned: “young adults with disabilities”. Are you primarily referring to
				physical or intellectual disabilities? Or both? I’m only curious, is all. Perhaps that could be better
				clarified in your mission statement if your aim is to be inclusive of all individuals. Also, I think it
				would be helpful to provide an environment where “social outlets” as you’ve described could be enjoyed
				by all individuals with disabilities- both young children and adults. However, if the target demographic
				that you’re passionate about connecting with here is specifically young adults then I definitely
				understand!

			<h2> Interview 2: Jeni Zapor </h2>
			<p> <i>  Jeni Zapor is a graphic designer but she also volunteers in the youth group at a local church and has taught in schools as well. <br>She interacts with disabled students regularly and is seeking activities and communities for them. </i> </p>
			
			<p><strong> 1. What information are you looking for most often on this website? </strong>
				<br>
				I most often look for activities that my adult child with disabilities can participate in.
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong> 2. What do you enjoy about the website? </strong>
				<br>
				What I liked most were the color choices and the simplicity of the web design. It didn’t seem
				complicated to use.
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong> 3. What frustrates you on the website? </strong>
				<br>
				What I found frustrating was when I went to the Donate Services section and tried to read about it, the
				script kept jumping with the different sizes of those who donated. I never finished reading because it
				was super irritating.
			</p>

			<h2> Interview 3: Susan Pitcher </h2>
			<p> <i>  Susan Pitcher is an administrator at Cane Bay High School. She interacts with
				and oversees<br> disabled students daily and is seeking activities and communities for them. </i> </p>

			<p> <strong> 1. What information are you looking for most often on this website? </strong>
				<br>
				Testimonials and year established. I really had to look more into the links to get an understanding of
				what The Exceptional was promoting. Mission and welcome should be on the main.
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong> 2. What do you enjoy about the website? </strong>
				<br>
				Easy to navigate and nice graphics. Loved the gallery. Gave me a up front closer look at what the
				mission looks like
				physically.
			</p>

			<h2> Interview 4:  </h2>
			<p> <strong> 1. What information are you looking for most often on this website? </strong>
				<br>
				The information I am looking for most on this website is the mission and how I can volunteer or donate.
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong> 2. What do you enjoy about the website? </strong>
				<br>
				I enjoy that everything you want to navigate is clearly organized at the top of the page in the navigate
				bar. This makes trying to find what I am looking for a lot easier.

				<br>
				<br>
				<strong> 3. What frustrates you on the website? </strong>
				<br>
				While the colors are inviting, I think there is too much going on with the color scheme. Specifically, I
				think the "donate services" box color choice could be better. I think it is too dark and when you start
				typing, the text is black on a dark purple background and this is hard to read. I think color
				choices/schemes could be a little more neutral and thus easier to navigate.
