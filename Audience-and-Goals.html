				<h1>Audience and Goals</h1>
				<h2>Audience</h2>
				<p class="info"> Brainstorming activity to determine audience</p>
			</header>
			<p>To determine the audience of the website and organization, I grouped sticky notes into different
				categories and looked for connections. I landed on two overarching groups: Need Help and Give Help.
				These two groups will be looking for different types of information. Within those two groups, I looked
				for who would be supportive of the organization and who might be skeptical. I placed “families of Young
				Adults with disabilities” into both “Fans” and “Skeptic” categories since it depended on the family.
				This activity was greatly beneficial for expanding my concept of who would be considered a member of the
				audience. </p>

				<p>To determine the overarching goals of the website and organization, I filled out this chart
					and looked for connections. I looked for connections and overlap betweent the three catagories.
					<b>Goals that appear in all 3 categories:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Clear info on events</li>
					<li>Volunteer info</li>
					<li>Donations</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<b>Goals that appear in 2 categories:</b> Communicate character of organization
				</p>
